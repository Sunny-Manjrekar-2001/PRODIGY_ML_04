# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project implements a hand gesture recognition model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for intuitive human-computer interaction. The model is trained on the LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of hand gestures.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
